üöó Vehicle Price Recommender System
This project is a machine learning-powered Vehicle Price Recommender System built using Python and deployed via a Flask web application. It predicts the price of used cars based on various user inputs like manufacturer, fuel type, condition, and more.

üîç Project Overview
In the used car market, pricing can be highly inconsistent due to various factors such as brand, condition, fuel type, and mileage. This project aims to build a robust regression model to predict vehicle prices accurately. A user-friendly web interface was created where users can input their vehicle specifications and get an estimated price.
