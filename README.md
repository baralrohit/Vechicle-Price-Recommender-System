# ðŸš— Vehicle Price Recommender System


This project is a machine learning-powered Vehicle Price Recommender System built using Python and deployed via a Flask web application. It predicts the price of used cars based on various user inputs like manufacturer, fuel type, condition, and more.
            
            
## Project Overview
In the used car market, pricing can be highly inconsistent due to various factors such as brand, condition, fuel type, and mileage. This project aims to build a robust regression model to predict vehicle prices accurately. A user-friendly web interface was created where users can input their vehicle specifications and get an estimated price.

## Dataset 
The dataset used for this project was sourced from Kaggle:
https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/austinreese/craigslist-carstrucks-data

## code.ipynb â€“ Full project code including EDA, preprocessing, modeling, and evaluation.

app.py â€“ Flask web application for deployment.

final_random_forest_model.pkl â€“ Final trained model (not included in repo, to be added by user).

preprocessor.pkl â€“ Pipeline object with all preprocessing steps (scaling, encoding).

Cleaned_Car_data.csv â€“ Dataset used to populate dropdowns in the web interface.

## Skills & Tools Used
Programming: Python

- Libraries: pandas, numpy, matplotlib, seaborn, scikit-learn, joblib

- Machine Learning: Random Forest Regressor, K-Nearest Neighbors, XGBoost, Linear Regression

- Data Preprocessing: Label Encoding, One-Hot Encoding, Feature Scaling, Missing Value Imputation

- Model Evaluation: RMSE, MAE, RÂ² Score, Cross-validation

- Deployment: Flask Web Framework

- Version Control: Git & GitHub

## Machine Learning Workflow
1. Data Cleaning & Preprocessing
- Handled missing values and removed irrelevant columns

- Created new features (e.g., car_age)

- Encoded categorical variables and scaled numerical ones using pipelines

2. Model Training & Tuning
- Trained multiple regression models: Random Forest, KNN, and XGBoost

- Performed hyperparameter tuning for model optimization

- Selected the best-performing model based on evaluation metrics

3. Model Deployment
- Built a user-friendly web interface using Flask

- Preprocessed user input using the saved preprocessor pipeline

- Deployed the trained model for real-time price predictions

## ðŸ–¥How to Run This Project Locally
